# PulsepointScraperV2
Scrapes pulsepoint.org for emergency incidents and notifies you if certain conditions are met.



## Installation
1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/TrevorBagels/PulsepointScraperV2.git`
2. Navigate to the new directory `cd PulsepointScraperV2`
3. Install requirements `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
4. Make sure to configure before using!


## Configuration

To use google maps API, you'll need to supply an api key to "api_key" in the config. Otherwise, it'll do its best to use other options for geocoding addresses. 

For push notifications, you'll need [pushover](https://pushover.net/). Set the "pushover_token" and "pushover_user" to the application token and user token for your pushover account.

## Usage
Run `python3 -m dev`, and it should work.


## FAQ

Not that there are many people that ask me questions about this, but I'll go head and answer things I have been asked, and what I think people *will* ask.

* Q: The incidents are showing up in the console, but I don't get notified about them. Why?
  * A: The incidents you see in the console are ALL of the incidents for the agencies you are monitoring. To get notified, there needs to be a location properly configured. If an incident happens near that location, you'll be notified. If you'd like to monitor an entire city, create a location, setting the `"coords"` property of it to be the center of the city. Then, set the `"radius"` property to something like `"50mi"` (50 miles). Units, such as meters (`m`), kilometers (`km`), and feet (`ft`) work as well. The default radius, if none is set, defaults to 100 meters.
* Q: The program isn't finding the agency, how do I fix this?
  * A: Chances are, the agency doesn't exist, or you mistyped something. Check `agencies.txt` for a list of agencies. You can do a search in there to find the exact name for the agency you want to monitor.



Note: I just added incidentfilters.txt to the repository. By removing the `*`, PulsepointScraper will no longer notify you of incidents unless the incident type is listed in the file (line by line)

For example, if you wanted fire related incidents, you'd change incidentfilters.txt to 
```
Illegal Fire
Marine Fire
Outside Fire
Residential Fire
Vehicle Fire
Commercial Fire
```
(these aren't all the fire related incidents. Currently, this method is just a quick hack until I implement something better.)

Incident types can be found under `/dev/core/incident_types.json`.


# PPDB

PulsePoint DB is a "sub project" where instead of monitoring specific locations, I monitor every single agency, scanning each one every twelve hours. It doesn't scan and scrape from them all at once, instead it generates a schedule so that its API call are distributed evenly throughout each day. After scanning an agency, it collects all the information about each incident and inserts it into a MongoDB database collection. 

To use the program, create a mongoDB database called "pulsepoint", and then run 
`python3 -m dev.ppdb`

Additional configuration options are available in `dbconfig.json`
